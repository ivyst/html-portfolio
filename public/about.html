<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a designer with a huge appetitie for new challenges that need solutions. My background is in marketing and design but I also love to write and have a technical writing degree.</p>

<p>I have a website where I keep my portfolio pieces. Some of that work is poetry, graphics, books, social campaigns and photography, but I also have skills in developing strategy and communication plans
  I've helped small to large companies rebrand and develop digital marketing to reach consumers and the manufacturers who create products.</p>

<p>If I could do something really amazing with the rest of my exciting career, I would return to developing sustainability marketing and educational material
  for corporations and the consumers who use products. I love to make a difference, not just for the sake of people, but for the earth. I'm a nature lover.</p>
